# Adaptive PPO Training Approach for CarRacing

This document outlines our step-by-step approach to training a high-performing PPO agent for the CarRacing environment, reaching mean rewards of 500+ (where 900+ is considered solving the environment).

## Initial Assessment

**Starting point:**
- Mean reward: ~300
- Issues: Oscillating steering, frequent off-track excursions, inconsistent performance
- Model architecture: CNN feature extractor (256 features), actor-critic networks
- Training parameters: Default PPO settings

## Phase 1: Reward Shaping Improvements

**Changes implemented:**
1. Increased track penalty from 2.0 to 4.0
2. Added centerline reward (0.2 weight)
3. Increased steering smoothness penalty from 0.1 to 0.3
4. Increased survival reward from 0.05 to 0.1

**Rationale:**
- Higher track penalty discourages off-track driving
- Centerline reward encourages staying in middle of track
- Steering smoothness penalty reduces unnecessary oscillation
- Higher survival reward extends episode length

**Implementation approach:**
- Made all changes simultaneously to establish a new baseline
- Monitored KL divergence closely (high values indicated significant policy adjustment)

**Results:**
- Mean reward increased from ~300 to ~380 within 500K steps
- KL divergence spiked (0.5-1.5), showing major policy adjustment
- Episodes reached max length more consistently
- Increased reward ceiling (episodes reaching 500-600 rewards)

## Phase 2: Stability Improvements

**Problem observed:** Despite improvement, high variance in episode rewards (from -50 to +600)

**Changes implemented (one at a time):**
1. Reduced learning rate: 2e-5 → 5e-6 → 1e-6
2. Reduced entropy coefficient: 0.01 → 0.005
3. Increased target KL divergence: 0.03 → 0.1

**Rationale:**
- Lower learning rate stabilizes policy updates
- Lower entropy discourages excess exploration
- Higher target KL prevents policy oscillation

**Implementation approach:**
- Implemented each change after 200-300K steps of observation
- Evaluated effect before proceeding to next change

**Results:**
- More consistent performance (fewer catastrophic episodes)
- Policy loss decreased and stabilized around 0.01-0.03
- Mean reward stabilized at ~450-480

## Phase 3: Extended Experience

**Changes implemented:**
- Increased max_episode_steps from 600 to 800

**Rationale:**
- Allows agent to experience more of the track
- Encourages learning long-term driving strategies
- Provides more steps for recovery from mistakes

**Results:**
- Mean reward reached ~510-520
- Episodes consistently maxing out at 801 length
- Individual episodes reaching 700-840 rewards

## Phase 4: Track Discipline Enhancement

**Changes implemented:**
- Increased track penalty from 4.0 to 5.0

**Rationale:**
- Further discourage any off-track excursions
- Fine-tune track boundary respect

**Implementation approach:**
- Made change after stabilization at previous stage
- Allowed 300K steps of adaptation

**Results:**
- Initial dip in performance
- Recovery to mean rewards of ~510-515
- Reduced off-track incidents, but still some variance

## Phase 5: Racing Behavior Refinement

**Problem observed:** Agent performs "donuts" when off-track, struggles with sharp turns, and exhibits random steering on straightaways

**Changes implemented:**
1. Speed-dependent steering penalty
2. Off-track recovery guidance
3. Increased centerline reward weight from 0.2 to 0.5

**Rationale:**
- Speed-dependent penalty discourages sharp steering at high speeds, preventing spinouts
- Directional recovery guidance helps the agent rejoin the track efficiently instead of doing donuts
- Stronger centerline reward encourages maintaining an optimal racing line

**Implementation details:**
- Modified steering penalty: `steering_penalty = steering_change * steering_smooth_weight * (1.0 + speed * 0.1)`
- Added track return reward when off-track: `reward += np.dot(track_direction, car_direction) * track_return_weight`
- Increased centerline reward weight for better track adherence

**Expected results:**
- Reduced tendency to do donuts when off-track
- More stable steering behavior on straightaways
- Better handling of sharp corners
- More consistent episode rewards

## Current State & Future Refinements

**Current performance:**
- Mean reward: ~510-515
- Episode lengths: Consistently 801 steps
- Best episodes: 800-850 rewards
- Value loss: Still high (60-180)

**Planned refinements:**
1. Speed consistency reward to encourage smooth driving
2. Increased PPO epochs (10 → 15) for better data utilization
3. Further training at current parameters to exploit learned policy

## Key Lessons

1. **Incremental changes:** Making one change at a time allowed us to isolate effects
2. **Patience:** Allowing 200-300K steps between changes gave time for adaptation
3. **Monitoring loss metrics:** KL divergence and value loss provided important signals
4. **Reward shaping power:** Targeted rewards dramatically improved learning
5. **Balance exploration/exploitation:** Reducing entropy coefficient and learning rate at the right time maintained progress
6. **Racing expertise matters:** Applying domain-specific knowledge about racing dynamics improved agent behavior

## Implementation Details

The most effective reward components were:
- Track penalty (5.0)
- Centerline reward (0.5)
- Steering smoothness penalty (0.3, speed-dependent)
- Track return guidance (0.3)

The most effective hyperparameter changes were:
- Learning rate reduction (1e-6)
- Target KL increase (0.1)
- Episode length extension (800)

## Approach Philosophy

This training approach demonstrates the benefits of:
1. Starting with reward shaping to guide learning
2. Gradually stabilizing with hyperparameter tuning
3. Extending experience horizon
4. Fine-tuning with targeted penalties
5. Incorporating domain-specific knowledge (racing dynamics)
6. Incremental, monitored improvements

This methodical approach resulted in a consistently high-performing agent without requiring excessive compute or model complexity.
